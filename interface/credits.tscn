I didn't have time to work on anything but the mechanics, and I was working on the game the entire weekend, with long nights lol. Sorry if Bug :(

Everything but the audio was made from scratch, but I composed the music. I wanted to work on pixel art, but prioritized mechanics of the game instead.

                          Praise the Placeholders!!!
